# Unix Network Programming Book Solutions

Implementation of alternative solutions for the [**Unix Network Programming Book**](http://www.unpbook.com) on Linux Platform.

> All examples are tested on a vagrant instance running Ubuntu 14.04LTS.

## Description

This repository gathers source code examples of utlization of Unix Sockets API.  
The original examples for this book don't compile on modern Linux systems, so I
decided to start this project in order to make available an updated collection
of good examples for building communication programs using this powerful Socket API.
